About me- I'm committed to hard work and continuous learning, with a particular passion for  programming and machine learning. 
With two Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Bioinformatics, I've honed skills in Mathematics, Statistics, and AI/ML.
My expertise lies in crafting innovative models for analyzing various datasets. Throughout my PhD, I played a central role in diverse applied ML projects,
from genome-wide cell screening and histopathology to biomedical text mining using natural language models, consistently innovating to meet project goals.
My primary aim is to make impactful contributions to real-world challenges using AI/ML. Motivated by my passion for refining existing algorithms and 
innovating new ones, I strive to drive progress in this field, inspired by the unwavering support of my loving family, including my daughter and husband.
